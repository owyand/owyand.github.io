  <h3>info about me</h3>
  <p>I'm 19 living in Columbus, Ohio. I was exposed to computers and development at a young age, watching my father do web development and learning a little myself here and there. I went to OSU for computer science, but i decided to leave because of cost and my learning style. I am now persuing a Java certificate and will be keeping my LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal website updated as I continue to learn and teach myself new skills. If you think i could be useful to your team or a valuable hire, please don't hesitate to contact me: oliverwyand@gmail.com</p>
