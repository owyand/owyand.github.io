  <h3>about me</h3>
  <p>I am 19 years old. I was born and raised here in Columbus, Ohio. I graduated high school in 2021 and took 2 semesters at OSU for Computer Science. I enjoyed my time on campus but decided to leave because of my learning style. I've learned throughout my years that I work better when teaching and discovering new things for myself. Also, much cheaper! I am now persuing a Java certificate and will be keeping my LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal website updated as I continue to learn and teach myself new skills. If you think i could be useful to your team or a valuable hire, please don't hesitate to contact me: oliverwyand@gmail.com</p>
